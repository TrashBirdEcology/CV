I am pleased to apply for the Monitoring Coordinator serving the BLM Wyoming State Office and its stakeholders. I am currently a Research Ecologist and Mendenhall Postdoctoral Fellow in the Bioanalytics and Innovations Lab of the US Geological Survey's Core Science Systems Science Analytics and Synthesis group. 

I am a trained ecologist with a strong background in quantitative ecology, analysis of long-term monitoring data, software development, and avian and invasion ecology. My research largely operates at the intersection of data and information synthesis, applied statistics, and digital scientific workflows. My work is largely motivated by two things. First, the perpetual disparity among the (actionable) science needs of natural resource practitioners and the informational and budgetary resource availabity to those same practitioners. Second, ecological data is expensive, noisy, and often disparate. The ability to re-use existing data and design future monitoring efforts that are broadly applicable is important for gaining actionable insights under ever-shrinking budgets. 

Abrupt and unexpected changes in ecological systems (also referred to as regime shifts) can lead to undesirable changes, and regime shifts are apparently being exacerbated by impacts of the anthropocene. In the research community, there is an ongoing thrust to apply statistical methods to observational data to both identify and forecast these changes. However, the relevance of such quantitative methods for forecasting such changes are not tested nor are applied to real-world systems. As a doctoral student, I conducted research that evaluated the efficacy of statistical and mathematical methods for identifying regime shifts in ecological communities. I currently co-lead an international and funded working group that continues to develop and evaluate feasible, applied statistical methods for identifying abrupt changes in observational data for both terrestrial and aquatic systems. 

As a Mendenhall Postdoctoral Fellow in the US Geological Survey, I have worked closely with federal, state, and university researchers, decision makers, and natural resource managers to develop knowledge management systems for avian ecology and conservation in North Amerca. Knowledge management systems comprise the data, information, tools, workflows, and human resources used to create, share, and evolve understanding, or knowledge. My research in this area focuses on (i) scientific software development, (ii) creating, evaluating and communicating digital interactive tools (e.g., web applications, dynamic reports, scientific software) for natural resource science and management, and (iii) identifying and improving data and information flows and synthesis. Such systems for creating and transferring scientific knowledge contributes to effecetive use of government resources and improves the efficiency by which science is conducted.

As a Monitoring Coordinator, I will use the best available science to inform monitoring program design and data analysis. My experience working closely with natural resource practitioners at many levels, including federal agency Deputy ADs, academic research scientists, international consortiums, and state agency biologists, has provided me with the skills and understanding required to identify the science needs of partners, and to provide timely, actionable science for decision makers and other stakeholders in your Region. Importantly, my research surrounding digital scientific workflows and communications will help improve the efficiency by which BLM and partner monitoring programs are conducted, documented, preserved, interpreted, and communicated.
